# Project Title

Function And Error

## Description

For this project, write a smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements.

## Getting Started
* The setNum function uses the require() statement to validate the input value and ensure it is greater than zero.
* The safevalue function uses the assert() statement to check for numer should not be equal to zero else revert it to intal state.
* The withdraw function demonstrates the usage of the revert() statement to revert the transaction with a custom error message if a certain condition is not met.

### Executing program
* Complile the contract.
* Then switch to depoly & run transactions.
* Then click on deploy.
* There will be are all variable then we can just put thr value to cheak the conditons for all the functions.
