# Project Title

Function And Error

## Description

For this project, write a smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements.

## Getting Started
* The setNum function uses the require() statement to validate the input value and ensure it is greater than zero.
* The safevalue function uses the assert() statement to check for numer should not be equal to zero else revert it to intal state.
* The withdraw function demonstrates the usage of the revert() statement to revert the transaction with a custom error message if a certain condition is not met.
